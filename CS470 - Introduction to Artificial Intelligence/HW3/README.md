# Bayesian Statistics

This project was to implement several methods of computing probabilities of events given a Bayes Net of conditional probabilities, to have a visualization of Bayesian statistics. A couple different sampling methods were implemented, namely rejection sampling and Gibbs sampling using Markov chaining.
