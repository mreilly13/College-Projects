# Solving a sliding puzzle using A* Search

# A* Search

This project was to use the A* search algorithm to solve a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle). We were expected to implement two algorithms that do so: one calculates progress towards the goal as simply having fewer tiles out of position, and one that calculates the distance of each tile to its final position and uses the sum of those distances to determine progress.
