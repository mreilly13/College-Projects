This project was to create a primitive shell program that can run on any linux-based system. This shell program, bsh, has the following features implemented:

1. env - view the environment variables
2. setenv - add an environment variable
3. unsetenv - remove an environment variable
4. cd - change the working directory
5. history - remember a history of the past 500 commands
6. other commands - any command not specifically implemented is passed through to the underlying shell
7. I/O redirection
8. piping
